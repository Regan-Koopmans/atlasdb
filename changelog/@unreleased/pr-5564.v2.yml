    add logging

    **Goals (and why)**:
    If a client is creating multiple KVSs in parallel, then we run validations for each of those creates. This adds GC pressure, and is arguably unnecessary.

    **Implementation Description (bullets)**:

    **Testing (What was existing testing like?  What have you done to improve it?)**:

    **Concerns (what feedback would you like?)**:

    **Where should we start reviewing?**:

    **Priority (whenever / two weeks / yesterday)**:
