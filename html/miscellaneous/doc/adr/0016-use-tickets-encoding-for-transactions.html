<h3>The Transactions Table in AtlasDB<a class="headerlink" href="#the-transactions-table-in-atlasdb" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In AtlasDB, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_transactions</span></code> table keeps track of whether a transaction that had started at a given timestamp
was committed or aborted (and in the case of it being committed, its commit timestamp). Logically, this table is a
mapping of longs to longs, with a special value of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-1</span></code> meaning that the transaction was aborted. Transactions that
are in-flight and have yet to either commit or abort will not have an entry in the table.</p>
<p>| startTimestamp | commitTimestamp |
|—————:|—————-:|
|             20 |              33 |
|             28 |              42 |

|        3141592 |         3141595 |</p>
<p>This table is accessed via the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TransactionService</span></code> class in AtlasDB, which offers a simple interface:</p>

<h3>Physical Representation in Cassandra<a class="headerlink" href="#physical-representation-in-cassandra" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>All AtlasDB tables have a similar schema in Cassandra:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>there is a blob partition key used to store rows, called the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">key</span></code></li>
<li>the clustering key has two more components:<ul>
<li>a blob for columns, called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">column1</span></code></li>
<li>a big-integer for the timestamp, called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">column2</span></code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>blob values.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_transactions</span></code> table, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">column1</span></code> is always a single byte corresponding to the string <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">t</span></code>, and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">column2</span></code> is a special value of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-1</span></code>. In practice, we don’t pay much attention to these values.
More interestingly, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">key</span></code> is a VAR_LONG encoding of the start timestamp, and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">value</span></code>
is similarly a VAR_LONG encoding of the commit timestamp.</p>
<p>The Cassandra representation of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_transactions</span></code> table introduced above may look as follows.</p>
<p>|        key | column1 | column2 |                  value |
|———–:|——–:|——–:|———————–:|
|       0x14 |    0x74 |      -1 |                   0x21 |
|       0x1c |    0x74 |      -1 |                   0x2a |
|       0x25 |    0x74 |      -1 | 0xff80ffffffffffffffff |
| 0xe02fefd8 |    0x74 |      -1 |             0xe02fefdb |</p>
<p>The details of VAR_LONG encoding are fiddly, but it exhibits several desirable properties:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li>VAR_LONG encoding is order-preserving over non-negative numbers; that is, if 0 &lt;= ts1 &lt; ts2
then VAR_LONG(ts1) &lt; VAR_LONG(ts2) and vice versa. This is significant, because it allows one to perform
range scans of the transactions table (given that timestamps in Atlas are positive longs) in a straightforward
way.</li>
<li>VAR_LONG encoding supports negative numbers, meaning that we can use the same encoding for both positive timestamps
(for transactions that successfully committed) and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-1</span></code> (for transactions that were aborted).</li>
</ol>
<p>However, our choice of encoding also has some issues. Two particularly relevant ones are as follows:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li>Under VAR_LONG encoding, numbers that are near to each other numerically will also be very close in byte-space
(notice that the encoded forms of 3141592 and 3141595 only differ in their three lowest-order bits). Furthermore,
most writes to the transactions table will take place at numbers that are numerically close, because these
correspond to actively running transactions, and thus at keys that are close in byte-space. Considering that
Cassandra uses consistent hashing to handle data partitioning, at any given point in time the majority of writes
to the cluster will end up going to the same node (‘hot-spotting’). This is undesirable, because we lose
horizontal scalability; writes are bottlenecked on a single node regardless of the size of the cluster.</li>
<li>VAR_LONG encoding is not particularly efficient for our purposes in that it fails to exploit some characteristics
of the distribution of our data. In particular:<ol>
<li>The special value <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-1</span></code> is particularly large; under VAR_LONG encoding, negative longs will always encode to 10
bytes.</li>
<li>Storing the full value of the commit timestamp is also wasteful, given that we know that it is generally slightly
higher than the value of the start timestamp.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<div class="section" id="principles-for-a-good-transaction-service">
<h3>Principles for a Good Transaction Service<a class="headerlink" href="#principles-for-a-good-transaction-service" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We thus define three principles that we can use to help guide our decisions as to what makes an implementation of
a transaction service a good one.</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><strong>Horizontal Scalability (HS)</strong>: A good transactions service must be horizontally scalable; that is, it should be
possible to increase write bandwidth by increasing the number of database nodes and/or service nodes that are
performing writing.</li>
<li><strong>Compact Representation (CR)</strong>: A good transactions service does not unnecessarily use excessive disk space.
In addition to saving on disk usage, having a compact representation also improves the ability for query results to
be cached in memory, and can improve time taken to execute queries if less data needs to be read through from disk.
Many key value services allow for caches with specified memory overhead; having compact timestamp representations
improves the ability of these caches to store more logical information, thus improving hit rates.</li>
<li><strong>Range Scans (RS)</strong>: A good transactions service supports range scans (without needing to read the entire table
and post-filter it). This is used in various backup and restore workflows in AtlasDB, and it is important that we
are able to execute restores in a timely fashion.</li>
<li><strong>Reasonable Usage Patterns (RUP)</strong>: A good transactions service, if using an underlying service, must follow
standard principles as to what constitutes a reasonable usage pattern of the underlying service.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Decision<a class="headerlink" href="#decision" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Implement the tickets encoding strategy, along with other features needed to support its efficient operation.
The strategy and supporting features will be introduced in the following sections.</p>
<div class="section" id="tickets-encoding-strategy-logical-overview">
<h3>Tickets Encoding Strategy: Logical Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#tickets-encoding-strategy-logical-overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We divide the domain of positive longs into disjoint <em>partitions</em> of constant size - we call the size the
<em>partitioning quantum</em> (PQ). These partitions are contiguous ranges that start at a multiple of PQ - thus, the first
partition consists of timestamps from 0 to PQ - 1, the second from PQ to 2 * PQ - 1 and so on.</p>
<p>We assign a constant number of rows to a partition (NP), and seek to distribute start timestamps as evenly as possible
among these NP rows as numbers increase. In practice, the least significant bits of the timestamp will be used as
the row number; we would thus store the value associated with the timestamps k, NP + k, 2NP + k and so on in the same
row, for a given partition and value of k in the interval [0, NP). To disambiguate between these timestamps, we use
dynamic column keys - we can use a VAR_LONG encoding of the timestamp’s offset relative to the base.</p>
<p>More formally, for a given timestamp TS, we proceed as follows (where / denotes integer division):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>we identify which row R TS belongs to; this is given by (TS / PQ) * NP + (TS % PQ) % NP.</li>
<li>we identify the column C TS belongs to; this is given by (TS % PQ) / NP.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that given R and C, we can similarly decode the original TS:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>we identify the relevant partition P; this is given by R / NP.</li>
<li>we identify the offset from the column key, O1; this is given by C * NP.</li>
<li>we identify the offset from the second part of the row key, O2; this is given by R % NP.</li>
<li>the original timestamp is then P * PQ + O1 + O2.</li>
</ul>
<p>It may be easier to think of the timestamp being written as a 3-tuple (P, O1, O2), where the row component is the
pair (P, O2) and the column key is O1; if NP divides PQ, then there is a bijection between such 3-tuples where O2 ranges
from 0 to NP (exclusive), and O1 ranges from 0 to PQ / NP (exclusive). Furthermore, this bijection is order-preserving
where ordering over the 3-tuples is interpreted lexicographically.</p>
<p>This diagram should illustrate more clearly how this works, for PQ = 1,000,000 and NP = 100.</p>

<h3>Physical Implementation of Tickets<a class="headerlink" href="#physical-implementation-of-tickets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We store information about transactions committed under the new encoding scheme in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_transactions2</span></code> table in
Cassandra.
Given that we want to avoid hot-spotting and ensure horizontal scalability, we need to ensure that the rows we may
be writing data to are distributed differently in byte-space. We thus reverse the bits of each row before encoding it.</p>

<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We are using a fixed-long encoding here, which uses a constant 8 bytes (instead of variable between 1 and 9). This was
chosen to ensure that range scans are supported, as the reversed forms of variable length encodings tend to not be
amenable to range scans.</p>
<p>For the dynamic column keys, we simply use VAR_LONG encoding.</p>
<p>We changed the encoding of values as well. For transactions that successfully committed, we used a delta encoding
scheme instead, where we take the VAR_LONG of the difference between the commit and start timestamps, which is
typically a small positive number. This helps to keep the size of the table down. Separately, for transactions that
were aborted, we store an empty byte array as our special value instead of a negative number, because that is
unnecessarily large.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="choosing-pq-and-np">
<h3>Choosing PQ and NP<a class="headerlink" href="#choosing-pq-and-np" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We choose values of PQ and NP based on characteristics of the key-value-service in which we are storing the timestamp
data, recalling principle RUP. To simplify the discussion in this section, we assume NP divides PQ.</p>
<p>For Cassandra, following the Atlas team’s recommended Cassandra best practices, we seek to bound the size of an
individual row by 100 MB. Considering that a VAR_LONG takes at most 9 bytes for positive integers, and we
can explicitly use an empty byte array to represent a transaction that failed to commit, we can estimate the
maximum size of a row for a given choice of values of PQ and NP.</p>
<p>Notice that the number of timestamps we actually need to store is given by PQ / NP (since each of the rows in the
partition is different). For a given start/commit timestamp pair, the row key occupies 8 bytes; that said, in SSTables
the row key only needs to be represented once. We thus focus on the column keys and values.</p>
<p>The column key is a VAR_LONG encoded number that is bounded by PQ / NP, as that’s the largest offset we might actually
store. The value theoretically could go up to a full 9 bytes for a large positive number, though in practice is likely
to be considerably smaller.</p>
<p>We selected values of PQ = 25,000,000 and NP = 16. Under this configuration, each row stores at most 1,562,500
start-commit timestamp pairs. Thus, the numbers for the rows only go up to 1,562,500, and VAR_LONG encoding is able
to represent these within 3 bytes. We do need to account for a bit more space as Cassandra needs to create a
composite buffer to include the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">column2</span></code> part of our physical row, but this should not take more than an additional
9 bytes. We thus have 12 bytes for the column key and 9 bytes for the value, leading to a total of 21 bytes per
start-commit timestamp pair. Each row is then bounded by about 32.04 MB, which leaves us quite a bit of headroom.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that in practice, for implementation reasons it is very unlikely that we have a full 1,562,500
start-commit timestamp pairs in a single row, and in practice values are likely to be only 2 or 3 bytes rather than
9 bytes. In any case, even under these adverse circumstances we still avoid generating excessively wide rows.</p>

<p>This was sufficient in the original transactions schema, because each row key only stores information about one
start timestamp; a putUnlessExists operation is then a CAS from an empty row to a row that has one column.
However, notice that this is not sufficient for transactions2, because each row may contain data about multiple start
timestamps. This API requires us to provide a list of the old columns, and we don’t know that beforehand.</p>
<p>We considered alternatives of reading the existing row and then adding the new columns, or using the CQL API, because
the behaviour of INSERT IF NOT EXISTS for columns matches the semantics we want. However, both of these solutions were
found to have unacceptable performance in benchmarking.</p>
<p>We thus decided to extend the Thrift interface to add support for a multi-column put-unless-exists operation that
has the semantics we want. This is different from CAS from an empty list, in that this succeeds as long as any of
the existing columns in the column family for the provided key do not overlap with the set of columns being added.</p>

<p>This is an improvement, but still runs into issues when clients (whether across multiple service nodes or on the same
node) issue multiple requests in parallel, because each put_unless_exists request requires a round of Paxos. Cassandra
maintains Paxos sequences at the level of a partition (key), so these requests would contend as far as Paxos is
concerned, even if the columns are actually disjoint. Internally, Cassandra nodes are trying to apply updates to the
partition; whether these updates are applied and the order in which they take place is agreed on using Paxos.
Although the nodes will be OK with accepting multiple proposals if they don’t conflict, only one round of consensus
can be committed at a time (since updates are conditional). Also, Cassandra uses a leaderless implementation of
Paxos, meaning that the ‘dueling proposers’ issue might slow an individual round of the protocol down if multiple nodes
are trying to concurrently propose values.</p>
<p>Batching requests on the client side for each partition could be useful, though that is still limited in that
performance would be poor for services with many nodes.</p>

<h4>Bloom Filters<a class="headerlink" href="#bloom-filters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Cassandra keeps track of bloom filters for each SSTable in memory to avoid having to read all SSTable data files. These
bloom filters keep track of whether an SSTable contains data for a specific row, and thus allows Cassandra to determine
without performing I/O operations whether a given SSTable</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>probably contains data for that row, or</li>
<li>definitely does not contain data for that row</li>
</ul>
<p>The probability a bloom filter returns a false positive is configurable via <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bloom_filter_fp_chance</span></code>, though more
accurate bloom filters require more RAM. Cassandra documentation suggests that typical values lie between 0.01 and 0.1.
Typically, within AtlasDB, the false positive rate is set depending on whether a table is append heavy and read light
(which means it is given the size tiered compaction strategy), and whether negative lookups are expected to be
frequent. This is determined by user schemas.</p>

<p>As far as transactions2 is concerned, we observe that the number of partitions is very small, and thus we can afford
a very low setting. We thus set <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bloom_filter_fp_chance</span></code> to 0.0001. Empirically, we observed that with this setting,
the bloom filter for the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_transactions2</span></code> table was about 15 KB after writing every timestamp from one to one billion.
In contrast, the bloom filter for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_transactions</span></code> with AtlasDB’s existing settings was 580 MB after doing this.</p>

<div class="section" id="index-intervals">
<h4>Index Intervals<a class="headerlink" href="#index-intervals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>In Cassandra, a partition index is an on-disk file that stores mappings from partition keys to their offset within
an SSTable. Cassandra maintains a partition summary for each SSTable in memory, which samples the partition index every
N keys and stores an offset for the location of the mapping for a given key within the file. The value of N may be
tuned; smaller values of N require more memory, but improve performance as seeks within the partition index will
be shorter.</p>
<p>For transactions2, the number of partitions is expected to be very small, so we set the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">min_index_interval</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">max_index_interval</span></code> to 1, forcing the partition index to be perfect.</p>

<div class="section" id="compression-chunk-length">
<h4>Compression Chunk Length<a class="headerlink" href="#compression-chunk-length" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Cassandra compresses SSTables by blocks on disk. These blocks are of configurable size; choosing larger blocks may
enable better compression (since similarities between columns or values may be exploited) at the expense of needing
to read more data from disk when a read occurs. Typically in Atlas, this is set to 4 KB to reduce the amount of I/O
we need to do.</p>
<p>For transactions2, we expect that some users will often be reading data from a relatively smaller working set. In this
case, using a larger chunk size enables better compression and increases the proportion of said working set that can be
maintained in memory. We experimented with several settings and found 64 KB to be a good balance.</p>

<h4>Empirical Evaluation of Cassandra Table Parameters<a class="headerlink" href="#empirical-evaluation-of-cassandra-table-parameters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>We ran several benchmarks on an internal testing stack, with different levels of concurrency and different hit rates
for the transactions table. For these benchmarks, we ensured that we actually performed disk operations to evaluate
performance. This was done by using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sstableloader</span></code> to ingest billions of timestamp pairs into the test stack, and
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">stress</span></code> tool to consume almost all of the free memory outside of Cassandra’s heap (to avoid operating system
page caches). We also had to create fresh <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TransactionService</span></code>s on each benchmark run to circumvent application-level

transactions2, so our optimisations have probably been useful.</p>
<p>It seems that there is a performance hit at lower percentiles for the 50% hit rate test, though we deem this to not
be too bad as each read of a miss will make future reads of the same value (modulo race conditions) be a hit, meaning
that this is unlikely to be a steady state.</p>

<p>A <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SlicePredicate</span></code> is a Cassandra struct that allows clients to specify which columns they want to read - these
columns are loaded for each of the keys presented. Notice that this method supports multiple keys but just one
predicate.</p>
<p>Thus, in Atlas when we try and perform a get of a collection of cells (which are row-column pairs), we first
group the pairs by column and then, in parallel, dispatch requests to Cassandra for each row that is relevant.
For example, if one’s cells were <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(A,</span> <span class="pre">1),</span> <span class="pre">(A,</span> <span class="pre">2),</span> <span class="pre">(B,</span> <span class="pre">1),</span> <span class="pre">(C,</span> <span class="pre">2),</span> <span class="pre">(C,</span> <span class="pre">3),</span> <span class="pre">(D,</span> <span class="pre">3)</span></code>, then Atlas would send three
requests:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>column <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1</span></code> and keys <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[A,</span> <span class="pre">B]</span></code></li>

<li>column <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">3</span></code> and keys <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[C,</span> <span class="pre">D]</span></code></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that in practice, the requests we make have to use a range predicate on Cassandra, because cells don’t include
timestamps, and the latest timestamp at which our cell existed isn’t something we know a priori.</p>

Atlas values had been committed, we will perform many requests in parallel. These requests will end up using many

</div>
<p>Implementing this endpoint on the Cassandra side was not too difficult. It may seem a little wasteful in that this may
require keys and predicates to be specified more than once, but for transactions2 these would likely be mostly
distinct.</p>
<p>While this improved performance, we still faced significant regressions relative to the v1 cell loader. We determined
that this was because Cassandra has a worker pool for loading values to satisfy a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ReadCommand</span></code>, but the calling
thread in requests is also allowed to participate. Thus, creating large batches would turn out to likely be detrimental
to read performance, even when the Cassandra nodes are actually able to handle higher concurrency safely.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="selective-batching">
<h4>Selective Batching<a class="headerlink" href="#selective-batching" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>We thus settled on a compromise between sending large singular requests and inundating Cassandra with smaller ones;
unlike in the original <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CellLoader</span></code>, we make the batch parameters configurable. There are two parameters:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>cross column load batch limit (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CC</span></code>); we may combine requests for different columns in one call to the DB, but
merged calls will not exceed this size.</li>
<li>single query load batch limit (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SQ</span></code>); a single request should never be larger than this size.
We expect <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SQ</span> <span class="pre">&gt;=</span> <span class="pre">CC</span></code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We still partition requests to load cells by column first. Thereafter,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>if for a given column the number of cells is at least <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CC</span></code>, then the cells for that column will exclusively take up
one or more batches, with no batch having size greater than <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SQ</span></code>.</li>
<li>otherwise, the cells may be combined with cells in other columns, in batches of size up to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CC</span></code>. There is no
guarantee that all cells for a given column will be in the same batch. However, we do guarantee this for columns
that are returned in a batch that are not the first or last column in that batch.</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of implementation, we simply maintain a list of cells eligible for cross-column batching, and partition this
list into contiguous groups of size <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CC</span></code>. In this way, no row key will be included more than twice. It may be possible
to reduce the amount of data sent over the wire to Cassandra and possibly some of the internal read bandwidth by
solving the underlying bin-packing problem to ensure that each row-key only occurs once; consider that we duplicate
many keys if we want to load <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CC</span> <span class="pre">-</span> <span class="pre">1</span></code> cells from many columns. This may be worth considering in the future (while
bin-packing is NP-complete, an algorithm like first-fit decreasing will give us a good approximation), but we have not
implemented it yet as the overhead is only a constant factor, and in many cases with transactions2 we expect the
number of cells per column to be small. Consider that assuming a uniform distribution, even if a single transaction
reads 1,000,000 values with PQ / NP = 312,500, the maximum batch size will probably not exceed 20.</p>
<p>For example, supposing one has cells partitioned by column, such that the number of cells with each column is as
follows. Further suppose that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CC</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">100</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SQ</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">300</span></code>.</p>
<p>| Column | # Cells |
|——-:|——–:|
|      A |      80 |
|      B |     200 |
|      C |      70 |
|      D |     688 |
|      E |      30 |</p>
<p>Columns <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">B</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">D</span></code> have at least <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CC</span></code> cells. Column <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">B</span></code> has fewer than <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SQ</span></code> cells, so they will be loaded
in a single request. Column <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">D</span></code> has between <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">2</span> <span class="pre">*</span> <span class="pre">SQ</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">1</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">3</span> <span class="pre">*</span> <span class="pre">SQ</span></code> cells, so its cells will be loaded in
three parallel requests.</p>
<p>The remaining columns all have fewer than <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CC</span></code> cells each. If we visit these columns in lexicographical order,
we will have a first batch consisting of 80 cells from column <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A</span></code> and 20 cells from column <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C</span></code>. We will have a
second batch consisting of 50 cells from column <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C</span></code> and the 30 cells from column <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">E</span></code> (though note that the
requests are done in parallel).</p>
<p>Notice that this is not optimal; we end up sending requests for cells from column <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C</span></code> twice, which incurs a network
and serialization overhead. It is possible to combine the requests for columns <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">E</span></code> in a single batch of
size up to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CC</span></code>, thereby removing this overhead. However, as discussed above this problem is computationally
difficult in general.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="benchmarking">
<h4>Benchmarking<a class="headerlink" href="#benchmarking" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>We tested the selective batching cell loader (“CL2”) against the original algorithm (“CL1”) and a full-batching
algorithm that always batches cells up to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CC</span></code>, regardless of what rows or columns they are from. We tested these
loaders against both general AtlasDB user workloads (100 rows/100 static columns and 1000 rows/10 static columns), and
workloads more specific to transactions2 (16 rows/500 dynamic columns). This is important as we would prefer not to
have to use a separate codepath for transactions2; current behaviour with loading queries on rows with many different
columns (regardless of table) had also previously been observed to be inefficient.</p>
<p>We first ran the benchmarks with a single thread against the aforementioned workflows. In our tests, CC = 50,000 and
SQ = 200; the dynamic columns are random and are unlikely to have overlaps. Times are reported in milliseconds.</p>
<p>| Rows |     Columns | Metric | CellLoader 1 | Full Batching  | CellLoader 2 |
|—–:|————:|——-:|————-:|—————:|————-:|
|  100 |  100 static |    p50 |        124.2 |          164.4 |        118.9 |

|  100 |  100 static |    p99 |        204.1 |          237.2 |        195.2 |
| 1000 |   10 static |    p50 |        122.6 |          169.4 |        118.6 |
| 1000 |   10 static |    p95 |        164.3 |          222.7 |        161.5 |
| 1000 |   10 static |    p99 |        170.9 |          269.1 |        188.0 |
|   16 | 500 dynamic |    p50 |        328.5 |          144.6 |        102.7 |
|   16 | 500 dynamic |    p95 |        432.3 |          195.5 |        143.8 |
|   16 | 500 dynamic |    p99 |        473.3 |          254.8 |        162.1 |</p>
<p>These results may be better visualised with a graph - for example, for p95 response times:</p>
<p><img alt="Graph reflecting p95 response times for each workflow and algorithm" src="../../../_images/0016-cellloader2-graph1.png" /></p>
<p>Notice that for the 100 rows test, CellLoader 2 performs marginally better than CellLoader 1, probably because it is
able to make 50 RPCs instead of 100 (recall that SQ = 200). The full batching algorithm performs the worst, probably
owing to Cassandra latency as there is only one requestor thread apart from the worker pool executing the request.</p>
<p>For the 1000 rows test, CellLoader 1 and 2 performance is very similar. This is expected, as the underlying calls to
the Cassandra cluster are the same (for each column, there is a single RPC). As before, the full batching algorithm
performs poorly.</p>
<p>However, for the 16 rows / 500 dynamic columns test, CellLoader 1 performance is very poor, as it may need to make as
many as 8,000 distinct RPCs owing to the different column keys. The full batching algorithm still suffers from having
just one requestor thread. CellLoader 2 is able to divide this into approximately 40 parallel RPCs, and performs
best overall.</p>
<p>We also ran the benchmarks with 10 concurrent readers on the same workflows. Times are reported in milliseconds.</p>
<p>| Rows |     Columns | Metric | CellLoader 1 | Full Batching  | CellLoader 2 |

|   16 | 500 dynamic |    p50 |       3141.8 |          899.2 |        888.4 |
|   16 | 500 dynamic |    p95 |       3390.1 |         1350.6 |       1189.0 |
|   16 | 500 dynamic |    p99 |       3497.2 |         1635.8 |       1307.2 |</p>
<p><img alt="Graph reflecting p95 response times for each workflow and algorithm" src="../../../_images/0016-cellloader2-graph2.png" /></p>
<p>The magnitude by which full batching does not perform as well as CellLoader 2 is also much lower. This is possibly
because the worker pool has a finite size and even with the full batching algorithm in this case, each reader
contributes one requesting thread. Although CellLoader2 spins up many more requesting threads on the Cassandra side,
the Cassandra cluster was unable to actually have these threads all do work concurrently.</p>
