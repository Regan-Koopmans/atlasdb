    endpoints:
      getNamespaces:
        http: POST /getNamespaces
        returns: set<string>
        docs: |
          The endpoint loads all persisted namespaces. ``leaderPaxos`` is filtered out from the set
          as it is not a namespace.

      achieveConsensus:
        http: POST /achieveConsensus
        args:
          namespaces: set<string>
        docs: |
          The operation of achieving consensus on all namespaces is NOT atomic. In the case of failures, it can
          be assumed that consensus was achieved on some namespaces.

      renewResources:
        http: POST /renew
        args:
          namespaces: set<string>
        docs: |
          Re-creates resources for a given TimeLock namespace. Does not actually cause a leader election. This operation
          is NOT atomic with respect to user requests that access multiple distinct resources on TimeLock server.
